This is a simple game of Snake. 

You can move arround the grid using the arrow keys

To run the game, open the jarfile from the terminal with the width and height as arguments.

i.e
.\02104---Indledende-programmerings-project.jar 10 10
where the first 10 is the width
and the second 10 is the height 
of the snakes grid.
